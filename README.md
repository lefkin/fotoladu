# Photo depository
This plugin creates a new temporary layer with locations of aerial photos taken by Estonian Land Board and stored for public viewing (http://www.maaamet.ee/fotoladu). The points are categorized based on the date of the photos. Make the new layer active and use the action tool to click on the points and open the photo in your default web browser.

IMPORTANT! The plugin is useful only for exploring Estonia. It's assumed your source CRS is EPSG:3301.
